          <p>During the 1920s, Auburn Avenue became the commercial center of Black Atlanta. And in 1956, Fortune Magazine named it "The richest Negro street in America." The phrase "Sweet Auburn" was coined by businessman and civil rights activist John Wesley Dobbs, the "Unofficial Mayor of Sweet Auburn" and the maternal grandfather of Atlanta's first African American mayor, Maynard Jackson. Today, the avenue is home to the Sweet Auburn Springfest, the Caribbean Festival & Parade, and the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Parade. There are many ways to spend a day in this iconic area</p>
