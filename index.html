    <p>The capital of the state of Georgia, Atlanta is home to more than 6 million people and is the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Initially founded as a terminus for a major state railroad, Atlanta quickly grew into a major city that has played key roles in the history of the country. As it grew and evolved over the years, it became an economic powerhouse as it currently has the 10th largest economy in the U.S. and the 20th in the world. This is due in part to being a major transportation hub, home to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport which is the world's busiest airport. It is also due in part to Atlanta being the home of several prominent corporations such as The Coca-Cola Company, The Home Depot, Delta Air Lines, AT&T Mobility, Chick-fil-A, UPS, and CNN. This "city in a forest" is also well known as being the national leader of the film and television industry with multiple box-office hits being filmed in the city. Each of these accomplishments has shaped the city into the gem it is today drawing in people from across the globe to call it home, but it has maintained great significance to the Black American community </p>
    <p>Often hailed as the birthplace of the Civil Rights movement, Atlanta has become a major epicenter of Black culture and entrepreneurial spirit. From the arts and music scenes to the vast array of opportunities available for black people, it has now been dubbed "Black Mecca". Home of the oldest and largest consortium of historically black institutions in the nation, Atlanta hold a wealth of opportunity for black people educationally and beyond. It attracts the most black professionals in the tech industry and has about 2.1 million black owned businesses which is the highest in the nation. Likewise, it is home to Tyler Perry Studios which is the largest film production studio in the nation and the first major film production studio owned by an African-American, Additionally, as of 2020, the Atlanta City Council remains majority black which is rare for city councils in major U.S. cities. Beyond that, Atlanta is a progressive city as it is considered a hub for black members of the LGBTQ+ community.  </p>
